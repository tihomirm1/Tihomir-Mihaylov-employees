Runs on:

There are some things to finish:

    - The application does not clear existing data before performing inserts. Only after rebuild.
    - Exceptions and rest responses need to be checked and optimized.
    - Multithreading is applicable. May be batch inserting.
    - Tests of date formats are required etc.
    - Constructors instead of Autowire
    - logging errors, some additional reordering etc.
